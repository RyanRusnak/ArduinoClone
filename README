Arduino Clone created in Eagle. Simply generate gerbers and ship them to a PCB manufacturer to order a PCB of the arduino clone. This is the first clone and although has the pins to program the ATMega, you must first burn a bootloader which can be a pain. I would recommend using an Arduino to load the code and then swapping the chip out. I will likely post a new eagle file of a smaller board without the programmer. ryanrusnak.com for questions.
